Cpp-Project-Template
====================

Creating a (large scaling) C++ project from scratch can be cumbersome. The purpose of this project is to provide a bootstrap project layout which makes this task more easy. This includes:

 * CMake build system
 * Vagrant Box with Jenkins CI
 * Googletest C++ Testing which has no external dependencies and builds inside the project

Some parts of this bootstrap project template are inspired by https://code.google.com/p/cpp-project-template/.
